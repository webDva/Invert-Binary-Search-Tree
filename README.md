# Invert-Binary-Search-Tree
An exercise in inverting binary search trees

# Implementing a Binary Search Tree

I'm not familiar with binary search trees as I recently started learning about them. [I used this Ecmascript 6 implmentation](https://codepen.io/david_i_smith/pen/egbJjQ) for creating the trees that will be used.

# The Process

First step is to create the tree data structure.

Then, we'll find out how to invert it so that for every a < b the new tree will have a > b.
